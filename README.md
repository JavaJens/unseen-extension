I've tried to add blocking for groups, however have not testet it yet.

# Unseen extension for Firefox

![Screenshot of Facebook's 'seen' status](http://i45.tinypic.com/2yv44r7.png)

Facebook has a new feature where the other party is notified once you read their message. Sometimes you may not want this for privacy reasons.

This extension simply blocks sending your 'seen' status from being sent to the other party.

Bug reports can be sent to tangrs at tangrs.id.au

## Known problems

If you open the other party's inbox, the 'seen' status will still be sent.

Since it indiscriminantly blocks the 'seen' status from being sent, it means Facebook won't know you've read the message either and will probably show a notification on your inbox icon.
